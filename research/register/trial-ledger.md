# Cumulative trial ledger (CONTRACT §9 — deflated Sharpe uses the TRUE count, program-wide, never reset)

Opened 2026-08-31, at design time — before any test has run. Every grid a sweep will touch is
logged BEFORE it runs; the deflated-Sharpe N is the cumulative product/sum of everything below
plus whatever is added later. Undercounting this ledger silently voids every significance claim.

| # | Sweep family | Grid size (committed at design) | Owner section | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hedge ratio × regime bucket | 7 × 4 = 28 cells | DESIGN §5.5 | pre-registered, not run |
| 2 | DD-violation test (z × K) | 3 × 3 = 9 | DESIGN §5.6 | pre-registered, not run |
| 3 | Grossman-Zhou α × response f | broad grid, size TBD before run | DESIGN §5.4 | to be sized before run |
| 4 | Hamilton filter h (two bands) | ~5 × 2 = 10 | DESIGN §11.1 | pre-registered, not run |
| 5 | τ_ref (band-width anchor) | grid TBD | DESIGN §7.3 | to be sized before run |
| 6 | f_Kelly ∈ [0.15, 0.35] | grid TBD | DESIGN §7.4 | to be sized before run |
| 7 | Cushion exponent p | small grid incl. p=1 | DESIGN §7.4 | to be sized before run |
| 8 | Participation cap per rank bucket | 5 buckets × grid | DESIGN §9.2 | to be sized before run |
| 9 | Impact coefficient Y ∈ [0.5, 1.0] | sweep | DESIGN §9.2 | to be sized before run |
| 10 | Momentum construct variants (12-1, 6-1, 52wk blends) | ~6–8 pre-registered constructs | D01 §6 | pre-registered, not run |
| 11 | Factor-weight grid (value/quality/low-vol/size ranges) | TBD before run | DESIGN §6.2 | to be sized before run |
| 12 | Stage-2 rung thresholds / reference forecaster | fixed pre-launch (not swept) | DESIGN §8 | frozen at design |

Rules: a rejected hypothesis is retired permanently (no re-test with tweaked parameters);
re-opening requires a new mechanism argument as a NEW ledger entry carrying its own count;
sweep families share one cumulative N — they are not separately-budgeted pools.
